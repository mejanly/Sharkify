Need to fix so either jaw is not moving on new sharks entering during feeding time OR
sharks that enter whose jaws are moving also swim faster.

Need to implement explosion.
	Consider: In shape, store the translation value for each piece used in the hierarchical modeling.
				 Once exploded, store that value and the move that way + the direction along a vector....
				 Or something??
