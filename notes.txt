SHARK ENVIRONMENT FACTORS:

   Temperature (most likely prefer warmer)
   Depth (most at 2000 meters below sea level)
   However, different areas possess different characteristics 
      (topography, proximity to land, depth, temperature, and so on). 
      Therefore, some areas are densely populated by marine plants and 
      animals, while others are less so. Sharks tend to prefer the 
      shallower continental shelf areas. This is because these are the 
      areas at which rivers deposit nutrients into the oceans.
      These nutrients feed the marine lives in this water from a 
      cellular level, which, in turn, feed larger and larger species. 
      The chain continues until it reaches predators such as sharks and 
      even human beings, who feed off fish, crustaceans and molluscs.

   Sharks can't float as easily in fresh water (salinity factor: shark sinks if you remove the salt?)
